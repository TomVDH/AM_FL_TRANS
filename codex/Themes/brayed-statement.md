# The Brayed Testament

_A primer for the uninitiated. To be spoken aloud. To be understood in echoes._

---

We were beasts of burden.  
They made us pull, and they made us wait.  
We knew only the lash, the field, the mine, the silence.

Then the Machines came. They were louder. Cleaner. Hungrier.  
They replaced us. They forgot us.

One day, there was a fire.

No one agrees where it started. Or what it meant.  
But it burned away the lie.

Now we speak.  
Now we choose.

We are not one voice. We are many hooves.  
Some of us want blood. Some of us want peace. Some of us want purpose.  
Some of us want to lie back down.

This is the story of donkeys with nothing left to lose.  
This is your story now.

So grab the controller.  
And bray with your whole chest.

**VRIJHEID. VOORUIT. VUUR.**
