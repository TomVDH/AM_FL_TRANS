# Myths & The Donkey Pantheon

## Overview

The mythology of _asses.masses_ blurs religion, memory, and broken philosophy. Donkeys inherit fragments of human faith and mix them with their own oral traditions. Myth shapes their politics, their grief, and their sense of purpose.

## 🐴 Key Mythic Figures

- Venerated spirits of past donkeys.
    
- Invoked for wisdom, strength, and continuity.

## Notes for Translation

- Myths should feel ancient, fragmented, and rural.
    
- Use poetic or elevated Flemish where possible (e.g., _de Eeuwige Hoef_, _de Verbrande_, _de Moddermuile_).
    
- Ambiguity is key—nothing should feel too explainable or rational.
