# Timeline & Revolutions

## Overview

Donkey history inÂ _asses.masses_Â is fragmented, mythic, and emotionally charged. It mixes allegory with speculative post-human narrative, portraying a species that inherits the wreckage of human industry and makes meaning out of trauma.

## ðŸ“œ Key Eras

### 1. The Time of Humans (pre-revolution)

- Donkeys are beasts of burden, bound to plows, mills, and mines.
    
- Constantly surveilled, de-individualized, and categorized.
    
- Machines are introduced gradually, replacing donkeys with automation.
    
- Emotional and intellectual life of donkeys is hidden, possibly repressed.
    

### 2. The Rise of the Machines

- Machines surpass donkeys in efficiency, triggering mass obsolescence.
    
- Many donkeys are abandoned, sold, or left to die.
    
- The mine collapse kills [[lazy-ass|Lazy Ass]] â€” a critical trauma.
    
- [[sad-ass|Sad Ass]]'s grief marks the moment when emotion becomes political.
    
- The world becomes increasingly post-human, and Machines begin to act with ambiguous autonomy.
    

### 3. The Fire

- A mysterious, possibly divine or symbolic event.
    
- Destroys part of the landscape, reconfigures the herdâ€™s direction.
    
- Interpreted variously as punishment, liberation, or rebirth.
    
- [[foal|Foal]] is born after the fireâ€”signifying the first true donkey of the revolution.
    

### 4. The Early Movement

- [[old-ass|Old Ass]] begins philosophizing and organizing.
    
- [[smart-ass|Smart Ass]], [[big-ass|Big Ass]], and [[sturdy-ass|Sturdy Ass]] all represent different ideological approaches.
    
- [[trusty-ass|Trusty Ass]] is silent but present through it all.
    
- Donkeys start repurposing human tools and questioning divine authority.
    

### 5. The Time of Decision (current era)

- The herd has to choose: insurrection or retreat?
    
- [[kick-ass|Kick Ass]] pushes for violence; [[bad-ass|Bad Ass]] questions everything.
    
- Machines may offer allianceâ€”or destruction.
    
- The player, through collective control, guides this path.
    

## âœ¨ Historical Themes

- **Loss â†’ Identity**: From suffering comes awareness.
    
- **Obsolescence â†’ Power**: From devaluation comes agency.
    
- **Myth â†’ Action**: Donkey legends become revolutionary frameworks.
    

## ðŸ§¾ Notes for Translation

- Terms likeÂ _opstand_,Â _vergeten_,Â _brand_, andÂ _mijnramp_Â should be anchored in regional Flemish history and affect.
    
- Preserve ambiguity where history is uncertain or symbolic.
    
- Keep revolutionary language grounded yet poetic â€” reflect oral storytelling traditions.
