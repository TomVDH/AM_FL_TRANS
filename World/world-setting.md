# The Physical World

## Overview

The world of _asses.masses_ is bleak, tactile, and post-human. It blends elements of dystopian farmland, industrial collapse, and sacred ruin. The geography reflects both the scars of labor and the remnants of divine intervention.

## Key Locations

### 🏚️ The Farm

- The primary setting for much of the game.
    
- Once a site of forced labor and animal subjugation.
    
- Post-human, but still shaped by their vanished infrastructure.
    
- Crumbling barns, ration systems, and enclosures serve as visual metaphors for economic and social decay.
    

### ⛏️ The Mine

- Symbol of sacrifice and suffering.
    
- Collapsed in the past, killing [[lazy-ass|Lazy Ass]] and traumatizing [[sad-ass|Sad Ass]].
    
- Mining represents both literal extraction and metaphorical exploitation.
    
- May be considered a site of martyrdom or memory.
    

### 🔥 The Fire (and Burnt Lands)

- A pivotal past event—its exact cause is debated.
    
- Transformed the world politically and ecologically.
    
- Burnt areas are lifeless, haunted by ash and memory.
    
- Foal is born after the fire—signifying a new era.
    

### 🐴 The Commons

- Gathering place for the herd.
    
- May shift in meaning depending on political unity.
    
- Also symbolic of shared struggle and evolving solidarity.
    

### ⚙️ The Machine Zones

- Harsh, steel remnants of automation and control.
    
- Abandoned industrial areas, still dangerous.
    
- Possibly inhabited by hostile remnants or malfunctioning Machines.
    
- Represent the threat of technological domination.
    

## Visual Aesthetic

- Pixel-art desaturation, harsh contrast.
    
- Organic elements (mud, wood, hay) meet steel, wire, and rust.
    
- Sky shifts dramatically between pastoral calm and storm.
    
- Weather and lighting help reflect the herd’s emotional state.
    

## Symbolic Geography

- Physical space is always ideological space.
    
- Proximity to the Farm = tradition, captivity.
    
- Movement to the Burnt Lands or Machine Zones = instability or transformation.
    
- Every terrain type reflects a political or emotional transition in the story.
    

## Notes for Translation

- Maintain rustic and symbolic language.
    
- Balance pastoral calm with latent menace.
    
- Use regional Flemish terms where appropriate to evoke tactile familiarity (e.g., _stal_, _schuurtje_, _koer_).
